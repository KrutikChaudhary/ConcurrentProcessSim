Single Process Tests
====================
00: Process with DOOP, BLOCK, DOOP, BLOCK, DOOP; with quantum > DOOP length
01: Process with DOOP, BLOCK, DOOP, BLOCK, DOOP; with quantum < DOOP length
02: Process with LOOPs, DOOPs, and BLOCKs; with quantum > DOOP length
03: Process with LOOPs, DOOPs, and BLOCKs; with quantum < DOOP length
04: Process with nested LOOPs, DOOPs, and BLOCKs; with quantum < and > DOOP length

Multiple processes, Round robin scheduling (priority = 1, for all processes)
============================================================================
10: 2 processes with single DOOPs of equal length
11: 2 processes with single DOOPs; DOOP of P1 > DOOP of P2
12: 2 processes with single DOOPs; DOOP of P1 < DOOP of P2
13: 2 processes: a process with a BLOCK and DOOP and a process with a DOOP and BLOCK
14: 2 processes: a process with a DOOP and BLOCK and a process with a BLOCK and DOOP
15: 2 CPU-bound processes
16: 2 I/O bound processes
17: 4 CPU-bound processes
18: 4 I/O-bound processes
19: 4 CPU-bound processes and 4 I/O bound processes

Multiple processes, Shortest Job First scheduling (priority = -1, for all processes)
20: 2 processes with single DOOPs of equal length
